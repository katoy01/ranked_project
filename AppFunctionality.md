# App Functionality
All data is sent to our mongoDB database and is called with axios calls.

# Home page
The home page will consist of all the posts added by all users for all game threads, ordered from most likes to least likes. <br/>

# Post thread
If you click on the post itself either from the home page or the game thread page, you will be redirected to the post thread, where you can comment on the post, and also comment on a comment. You can like and unlike posts and comments, which will change the order in which they are displayed (in decreasing order). There are basic CRUD functionalities for both posts and comments. <br/>

# Thread request
Any user can create a thread request, asking for the admin to add a game thread. Then the admin will go to the admin panel (a specific page only for the admin) and either approve or reject oncoming thread requests. <br/>
